Advantages of Generic Mongock Approach
1. Dynamic Migration Execution Based on JSON Configuration
   Your approach: Uses JSON-based configuration (changeunit_mapping.json) to dynamically apply changes across different MongoDB databases.
   Liquibase: Requires XML, YAML, JSON, or SQL changelogs, but lacks an intuitive way to dynamically handle multiple databases and operations in a single migration execution.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: Your approach enables parameterized and multi-database migration, reducing manual effort.

2. Multi-Database Migration with Dynamic MongoTemplate Selection
   Your approach: Dynamically initializes MongoTemplate per database (getMongoTemplateForDatabase).
   Liquibase: Typically works with a single database per execution and would require separate Liquibase contexts for each.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: If your system handles multiple databases, your approach scales better by dynamically switching databases.

3. Generic CRUD Operations Using CollectionData and CreateData
   Your approach: Defines a unified schema (CollectionData) to handle:
   Insert
   Update
   Delete
   Create
   Drop
   Rename
   Liquibase: While it supports MongoDB operations, the changelog must be explicitly written for each migration, reducing flexibility.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: Less redundancy, easier automation, and higher maintainability.

4. Integrated Change Logging (ChangeLog Table)
   Your approach: Logs every migration step in a change_log collection:
   ‚úÖ changeUnitId
   ‚úÖ operation
   ‚úÖ collections involved
   ‚úÖ success/failure
   Liquibase: Also logs migrations, but lacks custom logging tailored to MongoDB collections.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: Custom tracking and auditability‚Äîyou can easily query failed migrations or undo changes programmatically.

5. Conditional Execution of Change Units (existsByChangeUnitIdAndAppliedAtAfter)
   Your approach: Checks if a migration has already been applied before executing (isChangeUnitApplied method).
   Liquibase: Would require precondition checks manually added to each changelog file.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: Prevents redundant executions, ensuring migrations run only once.

6. Batch Processing with Transactions
   Your approach: Uses MongoDB transactions (ClientSession session) to commit or rollback migrations.
   Liquibase: Does not support transactions for NoSQL; MongoDB operations are executed individually.
   ‚úîÔ∏è Advantage: Ensures data consistency in case of failures.

Where Liquibase Might Be Better
Feature	                      Your Mongock Approach	              Liquibase
Declarative Migrations	      ‚ùå JSON-based, needs code	          ‚úÖ Fully declarative
Built-in Schema Versioning	  ‚úÖ Custom (change_log collection)	  ‚úÖ Managed automatically
MongoDB Index Management	  ‚ùå Custom code required	          ‚úÖ Built-in support
Conclusion: Which One Should You Choose?

üîπ Use Mongock (Your Approach) If:

You need high flexibility and dynamic multi-database migrations.
You want to log and track custom operations in MongoDB.
You prefer JSON-driven migration with a generic API for Insert, Update, Drop, etc.
You need transaction support to prevent partial failures.
üîπ Use Liquibase If:

You prefer a fully declarative approach (no custom service layer).
You are migrating from SQL databases and want a consistent changelog format.
Your MongoDB operations do not require complex conditionals.
üöÄ Your Mongock-based solution provides a more scalable and customizable approach for MongoDB migrations!
